## <div id="1">1. Outline


### 1.1. Introduction
This document provides a guide on how to install and environment setting of Zabbix Proxy with connection with the monitoring dashboard on the PaaS-TA Platform by collecting system resource information about the user's IaaS environment by measuring the usage and the after usage.


### 1.2. Range and Limitation
This guide is based on the following installation environment, so there may be some restrictions or limitations in installation or application for other areas not mentioned in the guide.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Virtual Machine OS</b></td>
    <td>Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>IaaS Vendor SW</b></td>
    <td>OpenStack 5.4.0 (Stein)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
 
 
### 1.3.Recommended Proxy Instances
Create an instance for installing Zabbix Proxy through the user's IaaS platform. The following is recommended as an instance specification for configuring Proxy in a Zabbix monitoring environment.

## <div id="2">2. Installation of Zabbix Proxy


### 2.1. Select Operation Environment
Visit the Zabbix official website to download the Zabbix Version, Operating System, and Type Version and receive an installation script suitable for your operating environment through the [Download](https://www.zabbix.com/download) page.

The installation script available on the **Zabbix Packages** tab allows you to download storage information that allows you to install all Zabbix-related packages, such as Zabbix Server, Proxy, and Agent. Because only the Zabbix Proxy needs to be installed at this stage, the script associated with installing other Zabbix packages is omitted, and only the script associated with installing the Zabbix Proxy and setting up the database is followed.

This guide selected and installed the Zabbix 5.0 LTS version of Proxy on Ubuntu 18.04 operating system and MySQL configuration on database SW. Therefore, it is recommended that you refer to the installation script available on the Zabbix official website, as the content of the guide may vary in part depending on the operating system, database, or web server SW type.


### 2.2. Zabbix Proxy Installation
Install Zabbix Repository.
```
$ wget https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/5.0/ubuntu/pool/main/z/zabbix-release/zabbix-release_5.0-1+bionic_all.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i zabbix-release_5.0-1+bionic_all.deb
$ sudo apt update
```

Install Zabbix Proxy.
```
$ sudo apt install -y zabbix-proxy-mysql
```

After verifying that the server's database is operational (enabled), create the database and account as follows, and exit the database prompt.
```
$ mysql -uroot -p
Enter password: 

...

mysql> create database zabbix_proxy character set utf8 collate utf8_bin;
mysql> create user zabbix_proxy@localhost identified by 'paasta';
mysql> grant all privileges on zabbix_proxy.* to zabbix_proxy@localhost;
mysql> quit;
```

Insert the schema and data necessary for Zabbix operation into the `zabbix_proxy` database you created as shown below. Since the password of the previously created account is requested, the appropriate password is entered (the guide set it to `paasta`).
```
$ zcat /usr/share/doc/zabbix-proxy-mysql/schema.sql.gz | mysql -uzabbix_proxy -p zabbix_proxy
Enter Password:
```

For Zabbix Proxy settings, edit the following items in the `/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.conf` file to suit each user's environment:
```
...

ProxyMode=0

...

Server=10.10.10.10

...

ServerPort=10051

...

Hostname=zabbix proxy 01

...

ListenPort=10051

...

DBHost=11.11.11.11

...

DBName=zabbix_proxy

...

DBUser=zabbix_proxy

...

DBPassword=paasta

...

DBPort=3306

...

ConfigFrequency=100	

...
```

> **[ Key Setup Parameters ]**  
. `ProxyMode`: `0` is an active mode, and `1` is a passive mode.  
. `Server`: Enter the IP address of the Zabbix Server.  
. `ServerPort`: Destination port number to communicate with Zabbix Server.  
. `Hostname`: Enter the hostname. The value set here is used as the proxy name in the Zabbix Server proxy setting.    
. `ListenPort`: Port number to communicate with Zabbix Server and Agent.  
. `DBHost`: Enter DB IP Address.  
. `DBName`: Enter DB Name.  
. `DBUser`: Enter DB User Information.  
. `DBPassword`: Enter the password of the DB access user.  
. `DBPort`: Enter DB Service Port Number.  
. `ConfigFrequency`: Frequency of the Zabbix Proxy on retrieving setup data from the Zabbix Server.

Insert the schema and data necessary for Zabbix operation into the `zabbix_proxy` database you created as shown below. Since the password of the previously created account is requested, the appropriate password is entered (the guide set it to `paasta`).
```
$ zcat /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-mysql*/create.sql.gz | mysql -uzabbix_proxy -p zabbix_proxy
Enter Password:
```

Restart the process and complete the Zabbix Proxy installation.
```
$ sudo systemctl restart zabbix-proxy
$ sudo systemctl enable zabbix-proxy
```

Once the Zabbix Proxy installation is complete, return to the **'3.3. Create proxy(Proxy Set up)'** section of the Zabbix Server Installation Guide and follow the proxy setup steps.
